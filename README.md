![logo_horizontal_light_theme](https://github.com/Ahmed9588406/python-panel/assets/101478632/c5c51c80-86a6-4d72-adcf-d02887d13497)
The powerful data exploration & web app framework for Python

Panel is an open-source Python library that lets you easily build powerful tools, dashboards and complex applications entirely in Python. It has a batteries-included philosophy, putting the PyData ecosystem, powerful data tables and much more at your fingertips. High-level reactive APIs and lower-level callback based APIs ensure you can quickly build exploratory applications, but you aren’t limited if you build complex, multi-page apps with rich interactivity. Panel is a member of the HoloViz ecosystem, your gateway into a connected ecosystem of data exploration tools.


To serve the dashboard locally, use the command
- panel serve DataScience.ipynb.ipynb

  ## About dataset
  Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. It’s widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.
